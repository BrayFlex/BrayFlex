### 🚀 Open to Work
I'm currently open to work opportunities. I specialize in:
- **Data Dashboards**
- **Web/Mobile Applications**
- **FinTech & Stock Market Solutions**
- **Game Dev** (side projects galore)
- **AI & Machine Learning**

### 🤷 Tech Stack
I've adopted a new language/software every year, the way I look at tech stacks is:
1. Does it impede me? No.
2. Does it impede the program? No.
Great, let use it.

### 💡 Beliefs
- **"The best inventions come from agency, not intelligence"**  
- **"If it takes > 1 day to plan, it's faster to just build it (FAaFO)"**  
- **"Code fast enough to make up for mistakes, or slow enough to avoid them"**  
- **"AI will accelerate knowledge beyond society's readiness"**  

### 🌌 Life Beyond Code
- 📈 **Investing** 
- 🔨 **Woodworking**
- 🏎️ **Cars**
- ⛺ **Survivalist Camping**
- 🍸 **Crafting food/drinks**
